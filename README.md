Project Description
At Knidos, we are building the first AI-driven hedge fund on Avalanche, combining cutting-edge artificial intelligence with decentralized finance to revolutionize trading, yield optimization, and fund management. Our goal is to make financial markets more accessible, transparent, and efficient by leveraging AI-driven signals, automated trading strategies, and blockchain-based fund structures.

By autonomously trading with pooled capital, our AI agent maximizes returns while distributing profits back to token holders. This creates a collaborative ecosystem where success is shared, and trust is built into every transaction.

The Problem We Solve
Traditional hedge funds and trading strategies are often:
Exclusive: Limited to institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals.
Opaque: Lack transparency in decision-making, leading to trust issues.
Inefficient: Rely heavily on manual intervention and outdated financial models.
Knidos addresses these challenges by building an AI-powered, fully transparent, and decentralized financial system that allows anyone to participate in hedge fund and yield strategies.


Our Solution
We are developing an AI agent that:
Generates trade signals for the top 100 tokens based on sentiment analysis, technical analysis, funding rates, concentrated lp yields optimisations and arbitrage opportunities.
Manages pooled capital autonomously to maximize returns, distributing profits back to token holders.
Provides financial insights through an interactive AI-driven assistant, making professional trading strategies available to all.
Combines on-chain data analytics, sentiment analysis, and autonomous trading algorithms to improve the precision and timing of cryptocurrency trades.
Supports staking and investment pools, allowing users to passively earn rewards.
Knidos enhances Avalanche's DeFi ecosystem by introducing AI-powered hedge fund infrastructure that automates trading, insights, and capital management. Our LLM-based insight manager, ML-powered trade signal generator, and funding rate arbitrage agent optimize market efficiency and create new investment opportunities. By integrating machine learning models, predictive analytics, and on-chain trading strategies, Knidos improves liquidity utilization, yield strategies, and risk-adjusted returns for both institutional and retail investors.
