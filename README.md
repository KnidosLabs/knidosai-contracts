Project Description
At Knidos, we are building the first AI-driven hedge fund on Avalanche, combining cutting-edge artificial intelligence with decentralized finance to revolutionize trading, yield optimization, and fund management. Our goal is to make financial markets more accessible, transparent, and efficient by leveraging AI-driven signals, automated trading strategies, and blockchain-based fund structures.

By autonomously trading with pooled capital, our AI agent maximizes returns while distributing profits back to token holders. This creates a collaborative ecosystem where success is shared, and trust is built into every transaction.
